Building Neeva for iOS
========================

Prerequisites, as of *February 15, 2022*:

* Mac OS X 11.3
* Xcode 13.2.1, Swift 5.5.2, and the iOS 15 SDK (Betas not supported)
* Carthage 0.37.0 or newer

When running on a device:

* A device that supports iOS 14 GM or later
* One of the following:
 * A developer account and Admin access to the *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles* section of the *iOS DevCenter*
 * A free developer account (create an Apple ID for free and add as an account in Xcode)

Get the Code
-----------

```
git clone https://github.com/neevaco/neeva-ios
cd neeva-ios
```

(If you have forked the repository, substitute the URL with your own repository location.)

Pull in Dependencies
--------------------

We use Carthage to manage some of the projects that we depend on. (Others are
fetched as Swift packages, which Xcode manages automatically.) __The build will
currently only work with Carthage v0.37.0 or newer__. If you do not already have
Carthage installed, you need to grab it via Homebrew. Assuming you have Homebrew
installed, execute the following:

```
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install carthage
```

You can now execute our `bootstrap.sh` script:

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

At this point you have checked out the source code for both the Neeva for iOS
project and built it's dependencies. You can now build and run the application.

Everything after this point is done from within Xcode.

Run on the Simulator
-----------------

* Open `Client.xcodeproj` and make sure you have the *Client* scheme and a simulated device selected. The app should run on any simulator.
* Select *Product -> Run* and the application should build and run on the selected simulator.

Run on a Physical Device (requires an active Apple Developer subscription)
-----------------

* Open `Client.xcodeproj` and make sure you have the *Client* scheme and your registered device selected. You might need to give your device's UDID to a Neeva employee.
* Execute our `Scripts/prep-for-physical.sh` script.
* Select *Product -> Run* and the application should build and run on your device.
