## History of the codebase

The Neeva browser stands on the shoulders of the excellent [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios) browser.
We forked on Feb 18 at [c23bd56293da4e2913e1d512ee559e784dd21e48](https://github.com/neevaco/neeva-ios/commit/c23bd56293da4e2913e1d512ee559e784dd21e48),
and the project has diverged substantially enough that it hasn't made sense to merge updates since.

Thank you to Mozilla for providing such a fantastic foundation for this project
and many others.
